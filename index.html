        <h2>Why I love dogs</h2>
        <p>
          Dogs make us better people. Having the paw-rental responsibility for our pet makes us think of someone other than ourselves. We want to make them comfortable and happy - and we learn to communicate in subtle ways that our furry friend can understand. We become more tolerant, affectionate and feeling, as we know we are entirely responsible for another being, one who loves us unconditionally and depends on us! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Loneliness is a very real fact of life for many people - with vulnerable groups, the elderly and infirm often feeling it the most. Aside from being bad for our health, prolonged and unwanted solitude can make us feel sad and can affect our self esteem. Aside from being a constant companion, dogs give us a reason to get out of the house. once outside, you are 80% more likely to talk to another human being if you have a dog. Dog owners create communities and unite neighbours and many argue actually form the 'fabric' of local societies!

      <div class="container" id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Dogs are descended from wolves… it’s TRUE! One thing is sure, our dogs of today are indeed descended from the grey wolf (Canis Lupus). Academics have long been arguing about the exact timeline and dates. Where and when did dogs split off from wolves? Some studies, all to do with studying genetic material, suggest that the split happened about 30,000 – 40,000 years ago; whilst others, suggest the split was much later, around 11,000 – 16,000 years ago. For our purposes here, we will just conclude it was many moons ago! Regardless of the exact history of the dog, it’s likely that domestic dogs appeared simultaneously in various areas of the world. Each of these came from their own wolf-like ancestors that were genetically similar.
        </p>
        <p>
          How did wolves become dogs? The process of domestication of wolves first happened when populations of wolves moved to the outskirts of hunter- gatherer camps to scavenge for food. The adaptability of the wolf to live on scraps rather than having to hunt for its food, benefited both wolf and man. Wolf cleared up after man, and man learned to trust that the wolves that came close would not attack them. This mutual trust must have developed over time. Those wolves who were tamer and less aggressive were more successful at maintaining and developing this relationship. Man began to use these tame wolves to their advantage, so they adopted cubs into their tribes and started feeding them. A symbiotic relationship developed and this was the basis of that relationship we so cherish today with our much loved doggy companions.
        </p>
        <p>
          While these wolves were gradually adapting to their environment, they were unknowingly genetically manipulating their own population. Over the generations, the original wild wolves had changed. They were now considered genetically different from the original wild stock that first lived alongside humans. These wolves were through natural selection, born tame. Presumably ‘tameness’ was the first ever trait selected by humans. It is from this point on that human intervention further shaped the nature of dogs as we know them.

        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p>
          Training your puppy basic commands. Most owners dream of their puppy growing into a well-behaved adult dog, but sometimes it can be difficult to know where to start! There are a few basic commands that ideally all owners should teach their dogs. They’re nice and simple and your pup will love to learn them! Consistency is key with puppies! It’s best for everyone in the family to use the same command words so your puppy doesn’t get confused.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, when you’re training your dog or puppy to do anything, you should always use positive, reward-based training. Dogs respond far better to positive training and are more likely to pick up what you are trying to teach them faster. It’s also worth noting that telling your dog off rarely helps with training. This is because we often find out our dog has done something they aren’t meant to when it’s already too late. If you tell them off after they’ve already chewed holes in your shoes, they really won’t understand what you’re telling them off for. It’s better to train them that good behaviour gets a reward rather than punishing the ‘bad’ behaviour. Sometimes when they are told off for bad behaviour, puppies can get confused and think you’re praising them. So, it’s best to praise the good behaviour and don’t mention the bad!
